"""Testing finding the location of the cursor"""
# Tests:
#  We don't have to predict resize patterns anymore.
#  Instead: Resize something and add some text.
#  Given 2 terminal states and the characters it took to get from one to the other
#    play back keypresses from initial state
#    manually linewrap that and count how many rows added
#    check that that's the old cursor position
# check that last two terminals have same dimensions
# ignore first
# playing process in blank terminal should give reverse of diff of 1 and 2
# 
#   Grander plan: use diagrams to describe the way that tmux window will be
#   modified!
#
#   Plan for now: just send keys and use
